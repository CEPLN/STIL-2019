# Submissions

<b><u>Language</u></b>: Papers can be written in Portuguese, English, or Spanish.

<b><u>Length</u></b>: We accept submissions of long and short papers. Long papers should describe complete work with significant results. Short papers may report work in progress, negative results, opinion papers, or application papers. Long papers may have up to eight (8) pages of content (including tables and pictures), with two (2) additional pages of references, and will be presented orally. Short papers should have up to four (4) pages of content, and one (1) additional page of references, and will be presented as posters. Authors should also indicate whether they accept their long paper to be reallocated as a poster should the reviewers recommend so.

<b><u>Format</u></b>: Paper formatting must follow the [SBC Guidelines](http://bit.ly/2jFbJTa)

<b><u>Reviewing Process</u></b>: All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least two experts in the field. The reviewing will be double blind and therefore papers should not display any information regarding their authorship in the header or body of the text. Self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “As we previously showed (Silva, 2005)…”, must be avoided. Instead, authors such use “Silva previously showed (Silva, 2005)…”.

<b><u>Submission Policy</u></b>: By submitting papers to STIL 2019, authors agree that in case of acceptance at least one author will register to the conference and present the paper. Furthermore, it is the conference policy that at least one of the authors of accepted papers has to register **before** the deadline for sending the camera-ready paper. Accepted papers without the respective author registration **before** the deadline will not be included in the online proceedings.

### Submission System

Long and short papers should only be submitted in PDF files via [JEMS System](https://submissoes.sbc.org.br/home.cgi?c=3310) by the deadline indicated in this site.
