Salvador, BA, Brazil, October, 15-18, 2019

STIL is the bi-annual Language Technology event supported by the
Brazilian Computer Society (SBC http://www.sbc.org.br) and by the
Brazilian Special Interest Group on Natural Language Processing

_**GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS**_

<b><u>Language</u></b>: Papers can be written in Portuguese, English, or
 Spanish.


<b><u>Length</u></b>: We accept submissions of long and short
papers. Long papers should describe complete work with significant
results. Short papers can report work in progress, negative results,
opinion papers, or application papers. Long papers may have up to
eight (8) pages of content (including tables and pictures), with two
(2) additional pages of references, and will be presented
orally. Short papers should have up to four (4) pages of content, and
one (1) additional page of references, and will be presented as
posters. Authors should also indicate whether they accept their long
paper to be reallocated as a poster should the reviewers recommend so.


<b><u>Reviewing Process</u></b>: All submitted papers will be reviewed
by at least two experts in the field. The reviewing will be double
blind and therefore papers should not display any information
regarding their authorship in the header or body of the
text. Self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “As we
previously showed (Silva, 2005)…”, must be avoided. Instead, authors
such use “Silva previously showed (Silva, 2005)…”.

<b><u>Submission Policy</u></b>: By submitting papers to STIL 2019,
the authors agree that in case of acceptance at least one author
registers to the conference and presents the paper. Furthermore, it is
the conference policy that at least one of the authors of accepted
papers has to register before the deadline for sending the
camera-ready paper. Accepted papers without the respective author
registration before the deadline will not be included in the online
proceedings.
