STIL is the bi-annual Language Technology event supported by the Brazilian Computer Society ([SBC](http://www.sbc.org.br)) and by the Brazilian Special Interest Group on Natural Language Processing ([CE–PLN](http://comissoes.sbc.org.br/ce-pln/)).

In 2019, it will be held in conjunction with both BRACIS 2019 (The 8th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems) and ENIAC 2019 (XVI Encontro Nacional de Inteligência Artificial e Computacional).

The conference has a multidisciplinary nature and covers a broad spectrum of disciplines related to Human Language Technology, such as Linguistics, Computer Science, Psycholinguistics, Information Science, among others. It aims at bringing together both academic and industrial participants working on those areas.

_**GUIDELINES FOR PAPER SUBMISSION**_

<b><u>Language</u></b>: Papers can be written in Portuguese, English, or Spanish.

<b><u>Length</u></b>: We accept submissions of long and short papers. Long papers should describe complete work with significant results. Short papers may report work in progress, negative results, opinion papers, or application papers. Long papers may have up to eight (8) pages of content (including tables and pictures), with two (2) additional pages of references, and will be presented orally. Short papers should have up to four (4) pages of content, and one (1) additional page of references, and will be presented as posters. Authors should also indicate whether they accept their long paper to be reallocated as a poster should the reviewers recommend so.

<b><u>Format</u></b>: Paper formatting must follow the [SBC Guidelines](http://bit.ly/2jFbJTa)

<b><u>Reviewing Process</u></b>: All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least two experts in the field. The reviewing will be double blind and therefore papers should not display any information regarding their authorship in the header or body of the text. Self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “As we previously showed (Silva, 2005)…”, must be avoided. Instead, authors such use “Silva previously showed (Silva, 2005)…”.

Furthermore, it is the conference policy that at least one of the authors of accepted papers has to register **before** the deadline for sending the camera-ready paper.
